## Configuration file 
The configuration can be sent to the device as a file that can by imported into the apps. This can be used to initially configure the device or change detailed settings later. 
 
* Create a configuration file in JSON with an `.otrc` suffix (for OwnTracks Configuration)
* Ensure the JSON is valid with [online JSON validator](http://jsonlint.com), [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or simply by running `python -mjson.tool < your.otrc`
* Send the file to the devices via e-mail, provide it for download on an HTTP server, send via Dropbox, ... you name it.
* Have the OwnTracks app user open the file on their device with OwnTracks.

Here is a sample configuration file which contains some of the possible settings.
```json
{
  "_type": "configuration",
  "auth": true,
  "username": "jjolie",
  "password": "s1kr3t",
  "host": "mybroker.example.org",
  "port": 8883
}
```
The `_type`entry is mandatory, most other entries are optional. They are replaced by built-in defaults or previously configured values if not specified. A list of all possible settings is described [on the JSON page](../tech/json.md).

## setConfiguration
The configuration of a connected app can also be changed remotely if _Remote Commands_ is enabled on the device, by publishing a JSON payload which is merged into existing configuration. A `_type: configuration` as described [on the JSON page](../tech/json.md) can be send to the device. 

## setWaypoints

Waypoints can be configured remotely if _Remote Commands_ is enabled on the device, by publishing a JSON payload which is merged into existing waypoints. (Note: the "key" for a waypoint is the `tst` timestamp, so overwriting an existing `tst` actually overwrites an existing waypoint.)

```json
{
  "_type": "cmd",
  "action": "setWaypoints",
  "waypoints": {
    "waypoints": [
      {
        "desc": "Some place",
        "rad": 8867,
        "lon": 10.428771973,
        "lat": 46.935260881,
        "tst": 1437552714,
        "_type": "waypoint"
      }
    ],
    "_type": "waypoints"
  }
}
```

Publishing the above payload to an OwnTracks iOS device will create/modify said waypoint. This also works for Beacon configurations, which are basically waypoints.

## URL config

Since January 2021, both iOS and Android apps can be configured by having the user click on an `owntracks:///config?inline=` URL containing a base64-encoded version of the content of an `.otrc` file.

Say we have a file called `j.otrc` with the JSON `_type: configuration` shown above. We can use, say, the _openssl_ utility to base64-encode encode the configuration into a single line:

```console
echo "owntracks:///config?inline=$(openssl enc -a -A -in j.otrc)"
```

which results in this text:

```
owntracks:///config?inline=ewogICJfdHlwZSI6ICJjb25maWd1cmF0aW9uIiwKICAiYXV0aCI6IHRydWUsCiAgInVzZXJuYW1lIjogImpqb2xpZSIsCiAgInBhc3N3b3JkIjogInMxa3IzdCIsCiAgImhvc3QiOiAibXlicm9rZXIuZXhhbXBsZS5vcmciLAogICJwb3J0IjogODg4Mwp9Cg==
```

We can then paste that text into the `@@` placeholder on an HTML like this:

```html
<html><body><p>
<a href="@@">Click to configure OwnTracks</a>
</p></body></html>
```

This link is then made available to click on after the user has installed the OwnTracks app for configuring it. By omitting, say, `deviceID` and `tid` it would be possible to "mass configure" a number of users' apps.
